# 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis of Crime Incidents

## 📊 Overview
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a crime dataset sourced from Kaggle. The objective is to uncover key patterns, relationships, and insights within crime incidents involving offenders and victims, using descriptive statistics and interactive visualizations.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Analyze the distribution of crime categories.
- Examine demographic profiles (age, gender, race) of offenders and victims.
- Investigate relationships and co-occurrences between demographics and crime types/outcomes.
- Assess typical outcomes (*dispositions*) of reported crime incidents.
